# Problem 1
You're encountering a very common issue when running OpenCV (which opencv-python and DeepFace depend on) in containerized or headless environments like AI Studio: ImportError: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.

This error indicates that a shared library that OpenCV needs for its graphical operations (specifically libGL.so.1, which is part of OpenGL, commonly used for rendering graphics) is missing from the system. Even if you're not explicitly displaying video windows, OpenCV often has this dependency compiled in.

pip install handles Python packages, but it doesn't install system-level libraries like libGL.so.1.
Solution: Install Missing System Dependencies

You need to install the missing OpenGL library on the system where your AI Studio environment is running. Since it's a Linux-based environment (judging by libGL.so.1 and jovyan@f37e6890d421), you'll typically use apt or yum (or mamba/conda if you're in a conda environment).

Common solution for Debian/Ubuntu-based systems (like many Docker containers):

You'll usually install libgl1-mesa-glx or libgl1.
Bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libgl1-mesa-glx


# Problem 2
sounddevice is a Python library that provides bindings for the PortAudio library, which is a cross-platform audio I/O library. Just like OpenCV needed a system-level graphics library (libGL), sounddevice needs a system-level audio library (PortAudio). pip install sounddevice only installs the Python wrapper, not the underlying C library.
Solution: Install PortAudio Library

You need to install the PortAudio development library on your AI Studio environment.

For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems (most common in Docker/cloud environments):
Bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y portaudio19-dev
